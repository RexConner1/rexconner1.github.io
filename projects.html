				<h2>Infrared Light Detector</h2>

					As part of EE 230, the class was given the task to create transmitter and 
					receiver circuits of infrared light, similar to the design to left (click to expand). The
					objective was to send out a signal via a button push, which ultimately would be interpreted
					as a red light. Pressing a second button would generate another signal and
					interpretation, resulting in a green light emission.

				<h2>Mars Rover</h2>
				<p class="expand">
					<a href="Images/rover.jpeg"><img src="Images/rover.jpeg" height="80" width="100" alt="Mars Rover" class="floatleft"></a>
					In Fall of 2015, I worked with a team of electrical engineering students to develop system
					design code to control and operate a robot (iRobot). To carry out this task, the team
					utilized the iRobot's built-in sensors as well as IR/SONAR inputs to successfully navigate
					the rover through an obstacle course to reach a specified target.

				<h2>Nintoaster</h2>
					<p class="expand">
					<a href="Images/nintoaster.jpg"><img src="Images/nintoaster.jpg" height="80" width="100" alt="Nintendo inside toaster" class="floatleft"></a>
					On a more personal side, I implemented circuit modification skills by inserting a custom
					PCB design of the original Nintendo inside of a conventional toaster. LED lights were also
					added to the toaster's onboard potentiometer for added lighting effect.
